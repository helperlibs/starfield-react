# HelperDev Code of Conduct - Our Mission

HelperDev is a community focused on encouraging continuous learning, supporting beginner developers, promoting collaboration, and contributing to the personal and professional growth of everyone involved.

We aim to foster a welcoming, inclusive, and safe environment across our community platforms, including repositories, discussions, and our official [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/YrHPaQB2yn) server.

## Our Pledge

As contributors, maintainers, and members of the HelperDev community, we pledge to make participation in our spaces a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to acting respectfully, welcoming newcomers, and supporting each other through kindness and empathy.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Offering mentorship and support, especially to beginner developers
- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy and patience

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Dismissing or ridiculing beginner questions
- Other conduct that would not be appropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

As the founder and primary moderator of HelperDev, Evelyn is responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct.

She will take appropriate and fair action in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Evelyn reserves the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all HelperDev-managed spaces, including GitHub repositories, discussions, and our official Discord server. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the HelperDev project or community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Although no formal report channel is established at this time, Evelyn (the founder) will monitor and take appropriate measures based on public or private concerns raised in the community.

All reports will be handled with care, confidentiality, and a commitment to a positive and respectful community experience.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.
